# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. 

As an eager Sports Analyst,  I want to help find insights into soccer data, so that I can different clubs with strategic decisions such as coaching and training. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Dataset: https://fbref.com/en/
- **League** (String) - name of the league
- **Squad** (String) - name of the club
- **G+A** (int) - number of goals and assists
- **Champions League** (String) - if they made the Champions League or not

## Description 

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

In our project, we created a project that included different data that you find in a soccer match. We used the league, club, goals and assists, and champions league data to achieve our mission in helping various clubs improve their strategies and tactics during a match. In our project, we use our data and traverse it so that we can print out the data that corresponds to the user input. The user inputted one of the top 5 leagues as the program used that information to output the different clubs, goals and assists, and champions league data from that specifc league. In conclusion, our project aims to help soccer teams with decision making and strategies, using data from mulitiple leagues.
